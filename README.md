# MNIST
A custom single-layered perceptron was created with input, output and weight layers to classify images using the MNIST and FMNIST datasets. 

Code developed using jupyter notebook. The main difference in implementation between MNIST and FMNIST is that MNIST has classes created for every layer from scratch whereas FMNIST leverages inbuilt functions in tensorflow to create each layer.
